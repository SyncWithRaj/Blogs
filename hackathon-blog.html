    <h1><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>From Clueless to Confident: My 1st Year of Hackathons</h1>

    <p>When I stepped into college for the first time, I had the same questions most first-year students have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where do I start?</li>
      <li>What should I learn?</li>
      <li>Am I good enough?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I had dreams. I had ambition. But I didn‚Äôt know where to begin.</p>
    <p>Then one day, I saw a poster for a hackathon. I had heard of them, but never thought I‚Äôd actually participate in one ‚Äî not in my very first year.</p>
    <p>Still, something inside me said: <strong>‚ÄúJust go. Experience it. See what happens.‚Äù</strong></p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> My First Hackathon: No Code, Just Curiosity</h2>
    <p>I walked into my first hackathon not as a developer, but as a complete beginner. I didn‚Äôt know the tech. I didn‚Äôt have a project idea.</p>
    <p>Everyone around me was typing furiously, setting up frameworks, talking about APIs‚Ä¶ and I was just sitting there ‚Äî confused, overwhelmed, and feeling small.</p>
    <p>So, I did what I could. I made a PowerPoint presentation of an idea I had. No code. No deployment. Just slides.</p>
    <blockquote>But that moment? It was powerful. It was the first time I told myself: ‚ÄúI may not know everything, but I‚Äôm here to learn.‚Äù</blockquote>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> The Turning Point: One Became Nine</h2>
    <p>That small step became a turning point. In the months that followed, I went on to participate in 8 to 9 hackathons ‚Äî all in my 1st year of college.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I got better at thinking creatively</li>
      <li>I started understanding how tech actually works</li>
      <li>I learned how to work in teams, manage time, and handle pressure</li>
      <li>I stopped fearing bugs, and started loving challenges</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sometimes we completed our ideas. Sometimes things broke at the last minute. And sometimes, we just sat there trying to fix a single bug for 5 hours üòÖ</p>
    <p>But in every single hackathon, I grew.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> What Hackathons Taught Me (Way Beyond Coding)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>üß† Learning doesn‚Äôt happen in silence ‚Äî it happens in chaos</strong></li>
      <li><strong>üí¨ Communication is as important as code</strong></li>
      <li><strong>üí™ Imperfect is better than never started</strong></li>
      <li><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Technical skills grow with action</strong></li>
      <li><strong>üíñ Confidence is built by showing up, again and again</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> If You‚Äôre in Your 1st Year Too‚Ä¶</h2>
    <p>You might feel like others know more than you. You might be scared to join because you think you're ‚Äúnot ready.‚Äù</p>
    <blockquote>You‚Äôll never be 100% ready. But if you show up with 1% courage, the rest will follow.</blockquote>
    <p>Even if all you can do is make a PPT like I did ‚Äî do it. Even if you don‚Äôt have a team or project ‚Äî just go and observe. That one decision could be the start of something big.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-star"></i> One Year Later‚Ä¶</h2>
    <p>I look back now, and I see a completely different version of myself.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From someone who was afraid to open VS Code</li>
      <li>To someone who now confidently takes on challenges</li>
      <li>From just watching others build</li>
      <li>To becoming the person who actually builds</li>
      <li>From feeling ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù</li>
      <li>To realizing I was always enough ‚Äî I just had to start</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="highlight">My first year wasn‚Äôt about winning trophies. It was about winning belief in myself.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-flag-checkered"></i> This Is Just the Beginning</h2>
    <p>Hackathons taught me to think under pressure, learn on the go, solve real problems, and most importantly‚Ä¶ never doubt my potential again.</p>
    <p>So here‚Äôs to the bugs, the crashes, the last-minute fixes, the all-nighters, the failures, and the little wins ‚Äî they made me who I am today.</p>

    <footer>
      <p>And if my story inspires even one student to take that first step ‚Äî this blog was worth writing.</p>
      <p><strong>Because if I can do it, so can you.</strong></p>
